# Expression Transfer Using Flow-based Generative Models

This repository contains the results obtained from the experiments on expression transferring performed with the [Glow model](https://github.com/openai/glow) from OpenAI.

In this work, we continued with the approach of attribute manipulation proposed in the original [Glow paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03039), but instead of targeting attribute manipulation, we explored if the same technique could be used to transfer expressions between a source identity and a target identity. This approach could be the basis for creating deepfake content via face-swapping with flow-based generative models. Flow-based methods eliminate the necessity of person-specific training due to the property of invertibility being able to reconstruct any input image almost perfectly to human perception. Therefore, flow-based models are special candidates for deepfake methods since they could be able to create deepfakes of whoever the identity without training on this concrete person. Finally, in addition to the method itself for the transfer, we propose an evaluation pipeline of the generated images in terms of how similar the identity of the obtained image is with respect to its own identity (and with respect to the source identity) and quality of the facial expression itself in terms of Action Units.

The results can be easily reproduced by using our [Colab notebook] (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11npIn2RwZrQf7LIoOg548VvoDafzp2cz?authuser=1).
